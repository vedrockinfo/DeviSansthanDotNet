                    <p>Sometimes we take literacy for granted, but can you imagine what it would be like to not be able

                        Literacy is vital for people&apos;s social, emotional, and economic wellbeing. Yet there are
                        still
                        hundreds of millions

                        the key

                                    million adults in India are illiterate – this is by far the
                                    world&apos;s largest population of illiterates. While literacy rates have grown from
                                    64%
                                    to 74% between the 2001 and
                                    2011 Censuses, the rate of improvement is disappointingly slow. This lack of
                                    literacy
                                    has major negative
                                    consequences economically, politically and socially.</p>
                                <p>India has achieved near universal primary school enrolment rates. However, schools
                                    are
                                    often failing to make
                                    their students literate. The&nbsp;<a

                                    subtraction problem. The fact that so many students are failing to learn the basics

                                    school indicates the deep
                                    failings of our education system, showing the need for radical reform.</p>

                        <p>ALfA is a low-carbon education: children and adults learn to read using just a few thin
                            booklets
                            – that too
                            shared between a pair, and re-used many times. Hands-on learning materials are also locally
                            available and
                            biodegradable – like ice-cream sticks, pebbles and leaves. Better yet, ALfA inculcates love
                            and
                            curiosity for
                            the natural world through short stories and role-plays, which build knowledge and also

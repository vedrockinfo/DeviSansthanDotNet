                                        struggles with school, which had kept them from literacy. Inama was a diligent
                                        student but found it difficult to rote
                                        memorize the letters. Heena was a quick learner but spent most of the day doing
                                        domestic chores, and thus had little
                                        time for study. Meanwhile Muskan suffered from a liver ailment which kept her
                                        from
                                        attending school. Despite these
                                        difficulties, each of the three girls learnt to read in just 1 to 2 months.

                                        efforts showed us from the beginning

                                    <p>Shania, 9, was not enrolled in school when we first met her. Her father often
                                        drank,
                                        so family finances were tight.
                                        Shaniya’s mother also doubted her ability to learn well in school. But Shaniya
                                        learnt to read swiftly using DEVI
                                        Sansthan’s literacy materials – just a daily 15 minute session several times a

                                        over 3 months. Impressed with this
                                        improvement, Shania’s mother enrolled her in the local school. Five years on (at
                                        the
                                        time of writing) Shania is now a
                                        confident young woman in Grade 8.</p>
